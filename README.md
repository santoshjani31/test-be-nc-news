# Northcoders News API

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PostgreSQL, and you will interact with it using node-postgres.

1 - Get /api will respond with all the endpoints that are listed in endpoints.json file.
2 - Get /api/topics will respond with an array topics object with the properties slug and description
